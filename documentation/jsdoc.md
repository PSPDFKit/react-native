## PSPDFKit

The [PSPDFKit SDK](https://pspdfkit.com/) is a framework that allows you to view, annotate, sign, and fill PDF forms on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Web.

[PSPDFKit Instant](https://pspdfkit.com/instant) adds real-time collaboration features to seamlessly share, edit, and annotate PDF documents.

This library requires a valid license of PSPDFKit. Licenses are per platform.

PSPDFKit for React Native exposes the most often used APIs from PSPDFKit. Many of our partners end up forking this repository and adding some custom code to achieve even greater integration with their products, using native code.

Windows is not currently supported, please use the previous version [1.24.9](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/releases/tag/1.24.9) instead.

Are you evaluating our SDK? That's great, we're happy to help out! PSPDFKit is a commercial product and requires the purchase of a license key when used in production. By default, this library will initialize in demo mode, placing a watermark on each PDF and limiting usage to 60 minutes.

To purchase a license for production use, please reach out to us via <https://pspdfkit.com/sales/form/>.
