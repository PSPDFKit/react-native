## React Native Library for PSPDFKit for iOS, Android & Windows UWP. (PDF SDK for React Native)

![PDF SDK for React Native](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/blob/master/article-header.png?raw=true)

This library requires a valid license of PSPDFKit. Licenses are per platform.

PSPDFKit for React Native exposes the most often used APIs from PSPDFKit. Many of our partners end up forking this repository and adding some custom code to achieve even greater integration with their products, using native code.

Windows is not currently supported, please use the previous version [1.24.9](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/releases/tag/1.24.9) instead.

### iOS

#### Requirements

- A [development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for running React Native projects using the React Native CLI (not the Expo CLI)
- The [latest stable version of Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- The [latest version of PSPDFKit for iOS](https://pspdfkit.com/changelog/ios/)
- The [latest stable version of CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/releases). If you don’t already have CocoaPods installed, follow the [CocoaPods installation guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) to install CocoaPods on your Mac.

#### Getting Started

Let's create a simple app that integrates PSPDFKit and uses the `react-native-pspdfkit` module.

1. In the terminal app, change the current working directory to the location you wish to save your project. In this example, we’ll use the `~/Documents/` directory:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

2. Create the React Native project by running the following command:

```bash
react-native init PSPDFKitDemo
```

3. In the terminal app, change the location of the current working directory inside the newly created project:

```bash
cd PSPDFKitDemo
```

4. Add the PSPDFKit plugin: 

```bash
yarn add github:PSPDFKit/react-native
```

5. Install all the dependencies for the project: 

```bash
yarn install
```

6. Open your project’s Podfile in a text editor to update the platform to iOS 12, and add the PSPDFKit Podspec: 

```bash
open ios/Podfile
```

Your Podfile should look like this:

```diff
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

- platform :ios, '10.0'
+ platform :ios, '12.0'

target 'PSPDFKitDemo' do
  config = use_native_modules!

  use_react_native!(
    :path => config[:reactNativePath],
    # to enable hermes on iOS, change `false` to `true` and then install pods
    :hermes_enabled => false
  )

  target 'PSPDFKitDemoTests' do
    inherit! :complete
    # Pods for testing
  end
+ pod 'react-native-pspdfkit', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-pspdfkit'
+ pod 'PSPDFKit', podspec: 'https://customers.pspdfkit.com/pspdfkit-ios/latest.podspec'
  # Enables Flipper.
  #
  # Note that if you have use_frameworks! enabled, Flipper will not work and
  # you should disable the next line.
  use_flipper!()

  post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)
  end
end
```

7. Change the location of the current working directory to the `ios` folder:

```bash
cd ios
```

8. Install the CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
pod install
```

9. Open your project’s Workspace in Xcode: 

```bash
open PSPDFKitDemo.xcworkspace
```

7. Make sure the deployment target is set to 12.0 or higher: 

![deployment-target](/screenshots/deployment-target.png)

8. Change View controller-based status bar appearance to `YES` in your project’s `Info.plist`:

![view-controller-based-status-bar-appearance](/screenshots/view-controller-based-status-bar-appearance.png)


9. Add the PDF document you want to display to your application by dragging it into your project. On the dialog that’s displayed, select Finish to accept the default integration options. You can use <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/downloads/pspdfkit-ios-quickstart-guide.pdf" download="Document.pdf">this QuickStart Guide PDF</a> as an example.

![drag-and-drop-document](/screenshots/drag-and-drop-document.png)

10. Change the location of the current working directory back to the root project folder:

```bash
cd ..
```

11. Open your `App.js` file:

```bash
open App.js
```

12. Replace the entire contents of `App.js` with the following code snippet:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Platform} from 'react-native';
import PSPDFKitView from 'react-native-pspdfkit';

const DOCUMENT =
  Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'Document.pdf' : 'file:///android_asset/Document.pdf';
export default class PSPDFKitDemo extends Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <PSPDFKitView
        document={DOCUMENT}
        configuration={{
          thumbnailBarMode: 'scrollable',
          pageTransition: 'scrollContinuous',
          scrollDirection: 'vertical',
        }}
        ref="pdfView"
        fragmentTag="PDF1"
        style={{flex: 1}}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

13. The app is now ready to launch! Go back to the terminal app and run:

```bash
react-native run-ios
```

### Usage

There are 2 different ways on how to use PSPDFKit for React Native on iOS.

- Present a document via a Native Module modally.
- Show a PSPDFKit view via a Native UI component.

Depending on your needs you might want to use one or the other.

### Native Module

Using the Native Module (`PSPDFKit.present()`), you can present a document with PSPDFKit modally in fullscreen.
You can specify the path to the document you want to present, and [configuration options](#configuration).

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { NativeModules, Text, TouchableHighlight, View } from "react-native";

var PSPDFKit = NativeModules.PSPDFKit;
PSPDFKit.setLicenseKey("YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE");

export default class App extends Component<{}> {
  _onPressButton() {
    PSPDFKit.present("document.pdf", {
      pageTransition: "scrollContinuous",
      scrollDirection: "vertical",
      documentLabelEnabled: true
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onPressButton}>
          <Text style={styles.text}>Tap to Open Document</Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

### Native UI Component

With `PSPDFKitView` you can use PSPDFKit like any other React component in your app.
Using this approach, you have more flexibility over how a document is presented and displayed.

The layout is completely flexible, and can be adjust with flexbox.

For all the `props` that you can pass to `PSPDFKitView`, have a look at the [source documentation](./index.js).

This is how you would show a PDF as a React component:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { NativeModules } from "react-native";
import PSPDFKitView from "react-native-pspdfkit";

var PSPDFKit = NativeModules.PSPDFKit;
PSPDFKit.setLicenseKey("YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE");

export default class App extends Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <PSPDFKitView
        document={"document.pdf"}
        configuration={{
          pageTransition: "scrollContinuous",
          scrollDirection: "vertical",
          documentLabelEnabled: true
        }}
        style={{ flex: 1, color: "#267AD4" }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

#### Configuration

You can configure the presentation with a configuration dictionary which is a mirror of the [`PSPDFConfiguration`](https://pspdfkit.com/api/ios/Classes/PSPDFConfiguration.html) class.

Example - Native Module:

```javascript
PSPDFKit.present("document.pdf", {
  thumbnailBarMode: "scrollable",
  pageTransition: "scrollContinuous",
  scrollDirection: "vertical"
});
```

Example - Native UI Component:

```javascript
<PSPDFKitView
  document={"document.pdf"}
  configuration={{
    thumbnailBarMode: "scrollable",
    pageTransition: "scrollContinuous",
    scrollDirection: "vertical"
  }}
/>
```

#### Running the Catalog Project

Take a look at the [instructions to get started here](/samples/Catalog/README.md#running-the-catalog-on-ios).

#### Running the Native Catalog

Take a look at the [instructions to get started here](/samples/NativeCatalog/README.md#running-this-sample-on-ios).

#### Running on Mac Catalyst

Using PSPDFKit for React Native on Mac Catalyst does not currently work due to a [Flipper and FlipperKit issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/28810).

If you wish to run your project on Mac Catalyst, please try the [following workaround which removes everything related to Flipper and FlipperKit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/28810#issuecomment-623357732).

#### Configuration Mapping

On iOS, PSPDFKit for React Native iOS maps most configuration options available in `PSPDFConfiguration` from JSON. Please refer to [`RCTConvert+PSPDFConfiguration.m`](./ios/RCTPSPDFKit/Converters/RCTConvert+PSPDFConfiguration.m#L267) for the complete list and for the exact naming of enum values.

Annotations are mapped based on their type name. This is case sensitive. For example, to limit annotation types to ink and highlight, use this:

```javascript
editableAnnotationTypes: ["Ink", "Highlight"];
```

#### Menu Item Mapping

On iOS, PSPDFKit for React Native allows you to specify a custom grouping for the annotation creation toolbar. Please refer to [`RCTConvert+PSPDFAnnotationToolbarConfiguration.m`](./ios/RCTPSPDFKit/Converters/RCTConvert+PSPDFAnnotationToolbarConfiguration.m#L47) for the complete list of menu items. To set them just specify the `menuItemGrouping` prop on the `PSPDFKitView`. The format used is as follows:

```javascript
[
  menuItem,
  { key: menuItem, items: [subItem, subItem]},
  ...
]
```

#### Customize the Toolbar Buttons

You can customize the toolbar buttons on the Native UI View component by specifying the toolbar buttons using `setLeftBarButtonItems` and `setRightBarButtonItems`, like so:

```javascript
pdfView.setRightBarButtonItems(
  ["thumbnailsButtonItem", "searchButtonItem", "annotationButtonItem"],
  "document",
  false
);
```

Please refer to [`RCTConvert+UIBarButtonItem.m`](./ios/RCTPSPDFKit/Converters/RCTConvert%2BUIBarButtonItem.m#L14) for the complete list of bar button items.

Also, please take a look at the [ToolbarCustomization example from our Catalog app](./samples/Catalog/Catalog.ios.js#L805).

For a more detailed description of toolbar customizations, refer to our Customizing the Toolbar guide for [iOS](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/customizing-the-interface/customizing-the-toolbar/) and [Android](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/android/current/customizing-the-interface/customizing-the-toolbar/).

#### Process Annotations

PSPDFKit for React Native allows you to create a new document with processed (embedded, flattenned, removed, or printed) annotations on Android and iOS using the `PSPDFKit.processAnnotations(annotationChange, annotationType, sourceDocumentPath, processedDocumentPath)` function. In the snippet below, we add a button which flattens all the annotations of the document from the currently displayed `PSPDFKitView` in a newly processed PDF file:

```javascript
<View>
  <Button
    onPress={async () => {
      const processedDocumentPath =
        RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + "/flattened.pdf";
      // Delete the processed document if it already exists.
      RNFS.exists(processedDocumentPath)
        .then(exists => {
          if (exists) {
            RNFS.unlink(processedDocumentPath);
          }
        })
        .then(() => {
          // First, save all annotations in the current document.
          this.refs.pdfView.saveCurrentDocument().then(success => {
            if (success) {
              // Then, flatten all the annotations
              PSPDFKit.processAnnotations(
                "flatten",
                "all",
                sourceDocumentPath,
                processedDocumentPath
              )
                .then(success => {
                  if (success) {
                    // And finally, present the newly processed document with flattened annotations.
                    PSPDFKit.present(processedDocumentPath, {});
                  } else {
                    alert("Failed to embed annotations.");
                  }
                })
                .catch(error => {
                  alert(JSON.stringify(error));
                });
            } else {
              alert("Failed to save current document.");
            }
          });
        });
    }}
    title="Flatten All Annotations"
  />
</View>
```

For a runnable example, please take a look at the [AnnotationProcessing example from our Catalog app](./samples/Catalog/Catalog.ios.js#L1032).

### Android

#### Requirements

- A [development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for running React Native projects using the React Native CLI (not the Expo CLI)
- The [latest stable version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- The [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)
- An [Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html) or a hardware device

#### Getting Started

Let's create a simple app that integrates PSPDFKit and uses the `react-native-pspdfkit` module.

1. In the terminal app, change the current working directory to the location you wish to save your project. In this example, we’ll use the `~/Documents/` directory:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

2. Create the React Native project by running the following command:

```bash
react-native init PSPDFKitDemo
```

3. In the terminal app, change the location of the current working directory inside the newly created project:

```bash
cd PSPDFKitDemo
```

4. Add the PSPDFKit plugin: 

```bash
yarn add github:PSPDFKit/react-native
```

5. Install all the dependencies for the project: 

```bash
yarn install
```

6. Open your project’s `build.gradle` file:

```bash
open android/build.gradle
```

7. Add the PSPDFKit repository to download the PSPDFKit library:

```diff
...
 allprojects {
     repositories {
         mavenLocal()
+        maven {
+            url 'https://customers.pspdfkit.com/maven/'
+        }
...
```

8. Open the app’s `build.gradle` file: 

```bash
open android/app/build.gradle
```

9. Enable `multidex` support:

```diff
...
  defaultConfig {
      applicationId "com.pspdfkitdemo"
      minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion
      targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion
      versionCode 1
      versionName "1.0"
+     multiDexEnabled true
  }
...
```

10. Add the PDF document you want to display to your application. You can download <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/downloads/pspdfkit-android-quickstart-guide.pdf" download="Document.pdf">this QuickStart Guide PDF</a> as an example.

11. Create the `assets` directory:

```bash
mkdir android/app/src/main/assets
```

12. Copy a PDF document into your `assets` directory:

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/Document.pdf android/app/src/main/assets/Document.pdf
```

13. Open your `App.js` file:

```bash
open App.js
```

14. Replace the entire contents of `App.js` with the following code snippet:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Platform} from 'react-native';
import PSPDFKitView from 'react-native-pspdfkit';

const DOCUMENT =
  Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'Document.pdf' : 'file:///android_asset/Document.pdf';
export default class PSPDFKitDemo extends Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <PSPDFKitView
        document={DOCUMENT}
        configuration={{
          thumbnailBarMode: 'scrollable',
          pageTransition: 'scrollContinuous',
          scrollDirection: 'vertical',
        }}
        ref="pdfView"
        fragmentTag="PDF1"
        style={{flex: 1}}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

15. The app is now ready to launch! Go back to the terminal app and run:

```bash
react-native run-android
```

#### Running the Catalog Project

Take a look at the [instructions to get started here](/samples/Catalog/README.md#running-the-catalog-on-android).


#### Running the Native Catalog

Take a look at the [instructions to get started here](/samples/NativeCatalog/README.md#running-this-sample-on-android).

#### Configuration

##### Upload PDF to device

To copy a pdf document to your local device storage:

```bash
adb push "document.pdf" "/sdcard/document.pdf"
```

##### Bundle PDF inside the APK's assets

To bundle a pdf document in the Android app, simply copy it the Android `assets` folder, for the Catalog app is `samples/PDFs`.

##### Viewer options

You can configure the builder with a dictionary representation of the PSPDFConfiguration object. Check [`ConfigurationAdapter.java`](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/pspdfkit/react/ConfigurationAdapter.java) for all the parameters available.

```javascript
const CONFIGURATION = {
  startPage: 3,
  scrollContinuously: false,
  showPageNumberOverlay: true,
  grayScale: true,
  showPageLabels: false,
  pageScrollDirection: "vertical"
};
```

#### Native UI Component

Just like on iOS we also support integrating PSPDFKit directly into the react-native view hierarchy. There are a few thing you need to consider when using this approach:

- Your activity hosting the react component needs to extend from `ReactFragmentActivity`.
- Because of [issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/17968) in react-native our `PdfView` needs to call `layout` and `dispatchOnGlobalLayout` on every frame, this might negatively affect your apps performance or even cause it to misbehave.
- `PSPDFKitView` doesn't yet support all the features (outline, bookmarks, thubmnail grid, view settings) using `PSPDFKit.present` provides.

##### Menu Item Mapping

On Android, PSPDFKit for React Native allows you to specify a custom grouping for the annotation creation toolbar. Please refer to [`ReactGroupingRule.java`](https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/pspdfkit/react/menu/ReactGroupingRule.java) for the complete list of menu items. To set them just specify the `menuItemGrouping` prop on the `PSPDFKitView`. The format used is as follows:

```
[
  menuItem,
  { key: menuItem, items: [subItem, subItem]},
  ...
]
```

#### Update

Upgrading yarn's lock file is required in order to update react-native-pspdfkit module in a project that has been already setup following the steps in [Getting Started](#getting-started-1) section.
From root project folder (e.g.`YourApp` for upgrading example project) launch `yarn upgrade`.

##### Migrate from PSPDFKit version 2.9.x to 3.0.0

After launching `yarn upgrade`, apply [step 7](#step-7), [step 10](#step-10) and [step 12](#step-12) from [Getting Started](#getting-started-1) section.
Enable MultiDex in `YourApp/android/app/build.gradle` (note **one** place to edit):

```diff
...
android {
    compileSdkVersion 25
    buildToolsVersion "25.0.2"

defaultConfig {
    applicationId "com.yourapp"
+   multiDexEnabled true
    minSdkVersion 16
    targetSdkVersion 25
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
    ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "x86"
    }
}
...
```

Remove `pspdfkit-lib` folder in `YourApp/android/`.
 In `YourApp/android/settings.gradle` remove the old reference to `pspdfkit-lib` (note **one** place to edit):

```diff
 project(':react-native-pspdfkit').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-pspdfkit/android')
 include ':app'
-include ':pspdfkit-lib'
```

##### Migrate from PSPDFKit version 3.3.3 to 4.0.x

After launching `yarn upgrade`, apply [step 6](#step-6), [step 8](#step-8) and [step 10](#step-10) from [Getting Started](#getting-started-1) section.
Enable MultiDex in `YourApp/android/app/build.gradle` (note **four** place to edit):

```diff
...
android {
-   compileSdkVersion 25
+   compileSdkVersion 26
-   buildToolsVersion "25.0.2"
+   buildToolsVersion "26.0.1"

defaultConfig {
    applicationId "com.yourapp"
    multiDexEnabled true
-   minSdkVersion 16
+   minSdkVersion 19
-   targetSdkVersion 25
+   targetSdkVersion 26
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
    ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "x86"
    }
}
...
```

#### API
